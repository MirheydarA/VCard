This project Purpose to automate the generation of vCard files using data retrieved from the RandomUser.me API. By fetching user information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, and locations, we can get information about users in virtual format. Users can specify the number of vCards to generate, and each vCard is saved as a .vcf file in a created directory.
